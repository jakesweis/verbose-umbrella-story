Once upon a time, there was a man named Lorenzo who lived in a cabin in the
mountains. The weather is always cold and snowy, but thats what he liked.
He enojoyed watching the sunrise and sunset every day. He enjoyed being in
the nature around him. His favorite thing to do during a really cold day was
to sit by the fire, drink hot chocolate, and read a good book. He enjoyed this
simple life. It all changed, however, the day the snow started to melt.

Lorenzo ran outside in a panic as his winter wonderland was reduced to an 
aquatic, post-apocalyptic nightmare. His hot chocolate had gone cold, his
cozy cabin was leaking from the melted snow. What could this mean for his 
future? The answer was uncertain. At least it was, until a rugged-looking
but kind-mannered stranger appeared from behind the redwoods around him.

"Who are you and what are you doing on my property", said Lorenzo. "My name
is Harold and I am just passing through the mountains on my morning hike." 
Lorenzo, with tears running down his cheeks, told Harold about how he loved his winter wonderland and how it is now ruined. Harold explained to Lorenzo that
the weather would still be cold higher up the mountain and offered to show 
Lorenzo the path the cold village up the mountain. And so the two began their
journey never to return...

It is said ever since that day, Lorenzo had lived in the village. He started
to enjoy the company, and he prefered it over his previous solitude. 

The End.
