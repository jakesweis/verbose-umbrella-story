Once upon a time, there was a man named Lorenzo who lived in a cabin in the
mountains. The weather is always cold and snowy, but thats what he liked.
He enojoyed watching the sunrise and sunset every day. He enjoyed being in
the nature around him. His favorite thing to do during a really cold day was
to sit by the fire, drink hot chocolate, and read a good book. He enjoyed this
simple life. It all changed, however, the day the snow started to melt.
